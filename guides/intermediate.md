# Intermediate Guide to Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the Intermediate Guide! In this guide, we'll introduce more advanced concepts like few-shot prompting and discuss some useful tools to make your prompt engineering workflow more powerful. By the end, you should be ready to create more sophisticated prompts and work with external tools that enhance your prompt engineering efforts.

## ü§ñ **Few-Shot Prompting**
Few-shot prompting is a technique that helps you provide context or examples to the AI model to improve the quality and accuracy of its responses. This is especially useful when the task at hand is complex or when you want to ensure the model follows a particular style.

### **What is Few-Shot Prompting?**
In few-shot prompting, you provide the AI with a few examples of the kind of output you expect before asking the actual question or task. This can dramatically improve the model's understanding.

- **One-Shot Example**: Give the model one example and then ask it to complete a similar task.
- **Few-Shot Example**: Provide multiple examples to better guide the AI.

**Example of Few-Shot Prompting**:
```
Translate the following phrases from English to French:
1. "Hello, how are you?" -> "Bonjour, comment √ßa va?"
2. "I would like a coffee." -> "Je voudrais un caf√©."
3. "Where is the nearest hospital?" ->
```
With this format, the model understands the pattern and can complete the translation based on the examples.

### **When to Use Few-Shot Prompting**
- **Complex Tasks**: When the task isn‚Äôt straightforward, and you need the model to follow certain conventions.
- **Maintaining Style**: If you need the response to follow a particular tone or structure.
- **Fine-Tuning Without Training**: Few-shot prompting can simulate some of the benefits of fine-tuning without explicitly training the model.

## üõ† **Tools for Prompt Engineering**
There are several tools that can help streamline your prompt engineering workflow and make the experience more efficient. Here are some of the most popular and useful ones:

### **1. OpenAI API**
The **OpenAI API** allows you to use models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 in your own projects. It‚Äôs flexible, enabling you to create applications or just experiment with different prompts.
- **How to Use**: You can sign up at [OpenAI's website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/), create an API key, and start interacting with the models through code.
- **Basic Example**:
  ```python
  import openai

  openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-003",
      prompt="Write a poem about the ocean.",
      max_tokens=50
  )
  print(response.choices[0].text)
  ```
- **Best For**: Anyone who wants to build custom applications, automate prompt testing, or experiment beyond the limitations of the web interface.

### **2. LangChain**
**LangChain** is a framework that helps you build powerful applications that utilize language models by chaining together components like prompts, memory, and more.
- **Why Use LangChain?** It allows you to create more sophisticated prompt sequences where outputs from one prompt can be fed into the next, creating a chain of thoughts.
- **Example Use Case**: If you want to build an interactive chatbot that keeps track of previous conversations, LangChain can help implement that memory capability.
- **Getting Started**: Install LangChain via pip:
  ```sh
  pip install langchain
  ```
  Example usage could be:
  ```python
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

  template = PromptTemplate(
      input_variables=["user_input"],
      template="You are an expert in cooking. Answer this question: {user_input}"
  )
  prompt_text = template.format(user_input="How do I make a perfect omelette?")
  ```

### **3. Prompt Libraries**
There are also community-built **prompt libraries** available that provide templates for common tasks. Websites like [PromptBase](https://www.promptbase.com) or [LearnPrompting](https://learnprompting.org) provide a wide selection of tested prompts you can use directly or modify as needed.
- **Why Use Them?** It saves time and offers inspiration for different types of prompts you may not have considered.
- **Best Practices**: Explore and modify pre-built prompts to better suit your needs.

## üìù **Advanced Prompting Techniques**
Beyond few-shot prompting, you can employ more sophisticated techniques to control the output and tailor responses.

### **1. Chained Prompts**
Break down a complex query into smaller, logical parts, and solve each step-by-step. This helps maintain focus and clarity, especially when the task has multiple components.

**Example**:
1. "Summarize the benefits of solar energy."
2. "List the key points of the summary in bullet points."

### **2. Dynamic Prompts**
Use variables or placeholders to create reusable prompts for different scenarios. This is particularly useful when automating tasks.

**Example**:
```
Generate a [tone] email that informs the customer about [event].
```
Where `[tone]` could be "formal" or "friendly" and `[event]` could be "a delayed shipment" or "an upcoming sale."

### **3. Testing and Evaluating Prompts**
Prompt engineering isn‚Äôt static‚Äîyou will need to **test** different versions and **evaluate** outputs.
- **Systematic Testing**: Create variations of prompts and see which performs best.
- **Evaluating Responses**: Use metrics like relevance, coherence, and creativity to evaluate which prompt gives the best results.

## üéØ **Next Steps**
- Practice using **few-shot prompting** by providing examples in your prompts and see how it changes the output.
- Experiment with tools like **LangChain** to build more dynamic prompt sequences.
- Take a look at our [Advanced Guide](./advanced.md) to explore even deeper techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and meta-prompting.
